In order to train the network, you first need to unzip data.zip (had to do it that way, file transmission to google cloud is very slow, so I use github, but they have a limit on the number of files you can upload in one folder). You need to have access to an environment with tensorflow aswell as a gpu otherwise it's going to be extremely slow. Make sure that the package tensorflow-gpu is installed, otherwise even with a gpu it's going to only use the cpu. I can provide you with a preconfigured vm instance if necessary.
An already trained version, upsample.h5 is already available.
